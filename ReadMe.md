# 👋 Welcome to My Digital Playground!

Hey there! I'm **Mashrafi Rahman**, a passionate Software Engineer from Dhaka, Bangladesh, with a laser focus on crafting seamless mobile experiences using Flutter. I thrive on turning code into innovative solutions that make life easier and more fun. Whether it's building cross-platform apps, diving into full-stack web dev, or experimenting with ML and game design, I'm all about pushing tech boundaries. Currently channeling my energy into Flutter mastery while exploring the vast tech universe – working on AI/ML, eager to collaborate on Flutter projects, honing advanced Python, and geeking out over HTML/CSS/PHP. Fun fact: I'm fascinated by space, time travel, and supernatural phenomena! 🌌
